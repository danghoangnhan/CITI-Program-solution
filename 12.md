## Research Ethics Quiz

### Question 1
**Q:** A sponsor proposes research to evaluate reengineering a commercially available pacemaker. It is hoped that the new pacemaker will pose fewer risks to individuals when compared to the current commercially available product. How should this device be classified?

**Your Answer:** Non-significant risk device

**Correct Answer:** Significant risk device

**Comment:** A significant risk device presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of the subject and it: (1) Is intended to be implanted into a human; (2) Is used in supporting or sustaining human life; (3) Is of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise prevents impairment of human health; or (4) Otherwise presents serious risk to health, safety, and welfare of a subject.

### Question 2
**Q:** An adult with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) presents to a physician. To date, no behavioral or drug interventions have proven useful. The physician has just read several reports about a drug that is approved and marketed for another indication but has shown some benefit for ADHD. The physician wants to prescribe this drug, in the labeled marketed dose, for the individual patient. Which of the following would be the most appropriate course of action?

**Your Answer:** Submit a research protocol for IRB review and approval before treating the patient

**Correct Answer:** Treat the patient with the drug based on the physician's best medical judgment

**Comment:** Based on the physician's best medical judgment, the patient may be treated with the drug since it is a marketed drug with an approved labeled dosage. An IND is not required. There is no research being conducted for the purpose of changing the labeling of the drug or marketing a new indication.

### Question 3
**Q:** An investigator proposes to study a marketed product sold to treat high blood pressure in individuals over age 12 using a liquid formulation for children under age 12. The drug sponsor hopes that the information from the research can be used to change the labeling for use of the drug in younger children. Which of the following is the investigator's most appropriate course of action?

**Your Answer:** Submit an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application to the FDA

**Correct Answer:** Submit the research protocol to the IRB for review and submit an IND application to the FDA before conducting the research

**Comment:** An IND is required. The investigator and the sponsor are proposing research that may change the formulation of the drug, the dosage, and the population (children) from the currently approved labeling for this drug. An IDE is not required as there is no device involved. Because this research is on drugs, it is under the primary purview of, and regulated by the FDA, not OHRP.

### Question 4
**Q:** The FDA's regulations related to electronic records and electronic signatures (21 CFR Part 11) are intended to:

**Your Answer:** Require use of electronic records for all drug research.

**Correct Answer:** Allow the use of electronic documents and signatures in the regulatory process for drugs and devices.

**Comment:** 21 CFR Part 11 Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures; Final Rule, often referred to as Part 11, was published May 20, 1997 and was intended to enable, but not require, the use of electronic documents in the regulatory process for drugs and devices. Part 11 specifies processes that must be in place assuring that electronic documents and signatures are equivalent to paper documents and handwritten signatures.

### Question 5
**Q:** An academic medical center is selecting a new database system for clinical research. The system needs to be "Part 11 compliant" in order to allow:

**Your Answer:** The medical center to replace the use of paper records with electronic records for its research.

**Correct Answer:** The medical center to replace the use of paper records with electronic records for its research.

**Comment:** Part 11 specifies processes that must be in place assuring that electronic documents and signatures are equivalent to paper documents and handwritten signature. Therefore, if an institution wants to eliminate all paper records for research, the electronic system must be "Part 11 compliant."
