### Question:
When reviewing federally supported research involving prisoners, an IRB must have which of the following, in addition to the standard requirements for IRBs to ensure that the prisoners' perspective is represented:

### Answer: 
One member who is a prisoner or prisoner representative

### Comment:
The HHS regulations require at least one IRB member who is a prisoner or prisoner representative. Individuals employed by the federal penal system, prison guards, wardens, parole officers, or health care providers at the local hospital where prisoners may be treated do not satisfy the regulatory requirements for prisoner representation on the IRB.

### Question:
When researchers plan to involve a prisoner population, which answer best describes the type of federally supported research that may be conducted:

### Answer: 
Research that is relevant to prisoners and their conditions or situations

### Comment: 
Research must first be relevant to the prisoner population although it may also be relevant to the general population; funding does not eliminate the regulatory requirements for protection of prisoner subjects; and there are circumstances where research involving more than minimal risk to the prisoner subjects may be conducted.

### Question:
The purpose of a federally supported research study is to examine the effect of scheduled cell searches on gang violence among men confined to drug treatment facilities under court order. Which of the following best describes the IRB's duties when reviewing this research?

### Answer: 
Because this research involves individual subjects who would be considered prisoners and examines the possible causes, effects, and processes of incarceration, the IRB should ensure that the additional requirements for prisoner research are met

### Comment: 
The HHS regulations, Subpart C, provide additional protections for individuals who are prisoners. Prisoners are defined as individuals involuntarily confined or detained in a penal institution. This includes individuals sentenced to these institutions under criminal or civil statute, those detained in other facilities under statutes or commitment procedures which provide alternatives to criminal prosecution or incarceration in a penal institution and those detained pending arraignment trial or sentencing. Because these subjects are considered prisoners, the IRB has additional duties when reviewing federally supported research.

### Question:
Due to past abuses, which of the following groups of potential research subjects has specific Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations to ensure additional protections when this population is being considered for research.

### Answer: 
Prisoners

### Comment: 
Prisoners are a population afforded additional protections under the HHS regulations: 45 CFR 46.301 – 306 – Subpart C – Additional Protections for Prisoners. Although the HHS regulations do not have specific additional protections for the elderly, mentally disabled persons, and men involved in research, investigators should consider and the IRB may require additional projections, precautions, or safeguards for these populations.
