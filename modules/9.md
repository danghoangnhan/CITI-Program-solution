**Question 1**
A federally funded research study involving children 8 to 12 years old involves collecting a single voided urine sample to assess the frequency of asymptomatic proteinuria (higher amounts of protein in the urine without any signs or symptoms of illness or infection). Your IRB has determined that assent of children age 8 and older is required for the study. A 10-year-old firmly declined to participate in the study described above. Which of the following procedures best describes the action to be taken by the investigator?

- Your Answer: Honor the child's decision.
- Result: Correct
- Comment: The assent of minors to participate in research is required, unless the "capability of some or all of the children is so limited that they cannot reasonably be consulted or that the intervention or procedure involved in the research holds out a prospect of direct benefit that is important to the health or well-being of the children and is available only in the context of the research" (45 CFR 46.408). The IRB determined that an 8-year-old was capable of providing assent for participation in this study, and in this situation, the child's decision cannot be overruled by the permission from one or both parents.

**Question 2**
A federally funded research study involving children 8 to 12 years old involves collecting a single voided urine sample to assess the frequency of asymptomatic proteinuria (higher amounts of protein in the urine without any signs or symptoms of illness or infection). According to 45 CFR 46, an IRB's risk assessment would likely conclude that this study involves:

- Your Answer: No more than minimal risk to the child.
- Result: Correct
- Comment: 45 CFR 46.102(i) defines minimal risk as the "probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests." Because the risk associated with the collection of a single voided urine specimen is not greater than risks encountered in the course of a routine physical examination, this research constitutes "minimal risk."

**Question 3**
An investigator proposes a study to determine the clinical relevance of a new assay technique to measure minimal residual disease (MRD) in adolescent (age 14-16) cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The study requires that two additional bone marrow aspirates be performed during the course of chemotherapy. The subject's chemotherapy will not be altered based on the results of the assay technique measures. However, future patients with cancer would benefit from improved interventions based on study findings. The IRB determined that the activity was a minor increase over minimal risk. Which of the following statements best describes the IRB approval requirements for involving adolescent cancer patients in the research study?

- Your Answer: Assent of the child only is required.
- Result: Incorrect
- Correct Answer: Assent of the child and permission of both parents are required.
- Comment: The research, as described, presents greater than minimal risk and no prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects but is likely to yield generalizable knowledge about the subject's disorder or condition. It is therefore potentially approvable under 45.406, provided: (1) the risk represents a minor increase over minimal risk; (2) the intervention or procedure presents experiences to subjects that are reasonably commensurate with those inherent in their actual or expected medical, dental, psychological, social, or educational situations; (3) the intervention or procedure is likely to yield generalizable knowledge about the subjects' disorder or condition, which is of vital importance for the understanding or amelioration of the subjects' disorder or condition; and (4) adequate provisions are made for soliciting assent of the children and permission of their parents or guardians.
