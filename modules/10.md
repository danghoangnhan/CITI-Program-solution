### Question:
Pregnant women, fetuses, and neonates are often considered vulnerable categories of subjects. Additional protections are provided through regulation, however, the protections are meant to be inclusive and not exclusive of pregnant women in research

### Answer

True

### Comment

This statement is true.

### Question

According to 1994 NIH Guidelines, which of the following is adequate justification for exclusion of women from NIH-funded research?

### Answer

There is compelling evidence that inclusion would be inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects.

### Comment

According to the 1994 NIH Guidelines, the only justification for exclusion of non-pregnant women of childbearing potential was compelling evidence that inclusion would be inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects, or to the purpose of the research.

### Question

A research study will compare a new combined behavioral and pharmacologic treatment with the standard behavioral treatment alone for individuals with severe seasonal affected disorder (SAD). The researcher wants to include pregnant women in the study. However, the pharmacologic treatment has not been previously studied in non-pregnant women, nor have preclinical studies on pregnant animals been conducted. Is this research permitted under Subpart B?

### Answer

No – this research is not permitted with pregnant women.

### Comment

This research would not be permitted per Subpart B because the following condition could not be met from 45 CFR 46.204(a), “Where scientifically appropriate, preclinical studies, including studies on pregnant animals, and clinical studies, including studies on nonpregnant women, have been conducted and provide data for assessing potential risks to pregnant women and fetuses.”

### Question

Can research subject to Subpart B and that includes pregnant women as subjects be exempt from the regulations, per 45 CFR 46, if all of the conditions of the exemption are met?

### Answer

Yes, each of the exemptions in 45 CFR 46.104 may be applied to research subject to Subpart B.

### Comment

Each of the exemptions in 45 CFR 46.104 may be applied to research subject to Subpart B if the conditions of the exemption are met.

### Question

A researcher wants to collect data about fetuses that were exposed to high levels of lead during their mother’s pregnancy. The researcher plans to review the medical records for a control group (not known to be exposed to high levels of lead) and an experimental group (exposed to high levels of lead) of fetuses from 12 weeks of gestation through delivery. Is this research permitted under Subpart B?

### Answer

Yes – research with neonates of uncertain viability may be involved because there is no additional risk

### Comment

Neonates of uncertain viability may be involved in research only if there is no added risk to the neonate, or the research’s purpose is to enhance the possibility of survival of the particular fetus to the point of viability.

### Question

The research study is no greater than minimal risk for the pregnant woman and the fetus, and holds the prospect of direct benefit to both the pregnant woman and the fetus. Who needs to provide consent under Subpart B?

### Answer

The mother

Yes – research with neonates of uncertain viability may be involved because there is no additional risk

### Question

A researcher wants to examine the efficacy of mushroom extract supplementation on fetal loss, low birth weight, and severe preterm birth in healthy pregnant women. She plans to enroll women who are 12-26 weeks pregnant and randomize them to either receive the intervention or placebo until delivery. The IRB determines this intervention presents greater than minimal risk to the pregnant women subjects, and potential direct benefit to both mother and fetus. Is this research permitted under Subpart B?

### Answer

Yes – this research is permitted because it presents the prospect of benefit to mother and fetus.

### Question

According to 1994 NIH Guidelines, which of the following is adequate justification for exclusion of women from NIH-funded research?

### Answer

There is compelling evidence that inclusion would be inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects.

### Question

Investigators wish to evaluate a new treatment for eclampsia (a life-threatening condition in pregnant women) in women 30 – 50 years of age. The research is intended to directly benefit the pregnant woman who is otherwise healthy and competent. The investigator must obtain consent from whom per Subpart B?

### Answer

The pregnant woman only.
