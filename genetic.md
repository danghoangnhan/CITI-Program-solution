**Question 1**
As of January 2015, the NIH expects investigators to obtain the informed (valid) consent of research participants in NIH-funded genetic research for broad research use of data and data sharing, even if the cell lines or specimens are:

- Your Answer: De-Identified
- Result: Correct
- Comment: The new NIH policy expects informed (valid) consent even when the source individuals for genetic data are not identifiable (de-identified) to investigators accessing and using the data.

**Question 2**
Which of the following statements is accurate in determining subject risk involved in a genetic study:

- Your Answer: Understanding the purpose and context of a specific study is critical in determining the risk involved
- Result: Correct
- Comment: Genetic research covers a broad spectrum of research from surveys and chart reviews to gene transfer studies. Therefore no assumptions should be made about risk in genetic research – each study must be evaluated on its own merits.

**Question 3**
Under which of the following conditions is it appropriate to re-contact the individuals who provided biological specimens?

- Your Answer: Original signed consent documents include provisions for recontacting subjects
- Result: Correct
- Comment: It is necessary to determine and document at the time of initial consent whether subjects wish to be re-contacted. It is critical to discuss with prospective subjects whether they may be re-contacted and whether they wish to receive further information, if available.

**Question 4**
When conducting research that involves collecting biological specimens for genetic testing, which of the following issues is the most important for the IRB to consider?

- Your Answer: Ownership of biological specimens
- Result: Incorrect
- Correct Answer: Effects of findings on other family members
- Comment: All of these issues are important in genetics research. However, potential effects of research findings on family members is the most important consideration.

**Question 5**
Investigator A has biological specimens that are coded and linked to identifiers of the source individuals. Investigator A provides the specimens to Investigator B but does not provide the individual identifiers. Investigator B agrees not to re-identify the source individuals. Is Investigator B’s research using the biospecimens human subjects research according to the definition of human subjects research in the federal regulations?

- Your Answer: No, because Investigator B cannot readily ascertain the identity of the source individual and Investigator B has agreed not to attempt re-identification.
- Result: Correct
- Comment: OHRP guidance stipulates that, in this scenario, Investigator B is not conducting human subjects research even though Investigator A can identify the source individuals. Investigator B must agree not to attempt re-identification of the specimens, although OHRP has not indicated that such agreements are subject to IRB oversight.
