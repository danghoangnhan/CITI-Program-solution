**Question 1**
Pregnant women, fetuses, and neonates are often considered vulnerable categories of subjects. Additional protections are provided through regulation, however, the protections are meant to be inclusive and not exclusive of pregnant women in research.

- Your Answer: True
- Result: Correct
- Comment: This statement is true.

**Question 2**
According to 1994 NIH Guidelines, which of the following is adequate justification for exclusion of women from NIH-funded research?

- Your Answer: There is compelling evidence that inclusion would be inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects.
- Result: Correct
- Comment: According to the 1994 NIH Guidelines, the only justification for exclusion of non-pregnant women of childbearing potential was compelling evidence that inclusion would be inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects, or to the purpose of the research.

**Question 3**
A research study will compare a new combined behavioral and pharmacologic treatment with the standard behavioral treatment alone for individuals with severe seasonal affected disorder (SAD). The researcher wants to include pregnant women in the study. However, the pharmacologic treatment has not been previously studied in non-pregnant women, nor have preclinical studies on pregnant animals been conducted. Is this research permitted under Subpart B?

- Your Answer: No – this research is not permitted with pregnant women.
- Result: Correct
- Comment: This research would not be permitted per Subpart B because the following condition could not be met from 45 CFR 46.204(a), “Where scientifically appropriate, preclinical studies, including studies on pregnant animals, and clinical studies, including studies on nonpregnant women, have been conducted and provide data for assessing potential risks to pregnant women and fetuses.”

**Question 4**
Can research subject to Subpart B and that includes pregnant women as subjects be exempt from the regulations, per 45 CFR 46, if all of the conditions of the exemption are met?

- Your Answer: No, research with pregnant women can never be exempt per 45 CFR 46.104.
- Result: Incorrect
- Correct Answer: Yes, each of the exemptions in 45 CFR 46.104 may be applied to research subject to Subpart B.
- Comment: Each of the exemptions in 45 CFR 46.104 may be applied to research subject to Subpart B if the conditions of the exemption are met.

**Question 5**
A researcher wants to collect data about fetuses that were exposed to high levels of lead during their mother’s pregnancy. The researcher plans to review the medical records for a control group (not known to be exposed to high levels of lead) and an experimental group (exposed to high levels of lead) of fetuses from 12 weeks of gestation through delivery. Is this research permitted under Subpart B?

- Your Answer: No – research with vulnerable populations is not permitted under the federal regulations
- Result: Incorrect
- Correct Answer: Yes – research with neonates of uncertain viability may be involved because there is no additional risk
- Comment: Neonates of uncertain viability may be involved in research only if there is no added risk to the neonate, or the research’s purpose is to enhance the possibility of survival of the particular fetus to the point of viability.
